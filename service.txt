STEPS TO TROUBLE SHOOT:
1. check status of pod. 
	# kubectl get pods -n <namespace> // Pod should be active and running.

2. check status of services. 
	# kubectl get svc -n "namespace" // Service should be active and running as nodeport.
    
3. If you already have a service, you should look at its configuration and see if the problem is there.

4. If service itself doesnâ€™t exist, you can create it by using this command:
	# kubectl expose deployment <your-deployment-name> --type="NodePort" --port=3000 service <svcname> exposed

5. Then describe service:
	# kubectl describe service <your-service-name>
    
    => Check if you used the right NodePort to access the container and that you have endpoints.
    => If you see some false information (like no endpoints), try to re-create the service and double check your kubectl expose command.
    
6. Please check, Is kube-proxy running?
   ps auxw | grep kube-proxy
   
7. Check Iptables mode:
    iptables-save | grep hostnames
    => For each port of each Service, there should be 1 rule in KUBE-SERVICES and one KUBE-SVC-<hash> chain. For each Pod endpoint, 
    => there should be a small number of rules in that KUBE-SVC-<hash> and one KUBE-SEP-<hash> chain with a small number of rules in it.
    => The exact rules will vary based on your exact config (including node-ports and load-balancers).
