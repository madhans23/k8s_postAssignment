DaemonSet	: It will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node.
NOTE		: Total Number of pods running in DaemonSet = Number of worker nodes in our cluster.
=> If a new node is added in our cluster then DaemonSet will automatically allocate pod on that node. 
=> Similarly, if a node is deleted then the pod running on the node is also destroyed.

USE CASE	: Using DaemonSet instead of a ReplicaSet for Pods that provide a machine-level function, such as MACHINE PERFORMANCE MONITORING or MACHINE LOGGING. 

General Example for DAEMONSET: 
Below is the configuration file for creating DaemonSet with nginx image. 
Saved this configuration in DemonSet.yaml file. 

apiVersion: extensions/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: my-daemon
spec:
  template:
     metadata:
       labels:
        app: nginx
     spec:   
       containers:
         â€“ name: nginx
           image: nginx
           
To create the Deamon Set, execute below commands.
	# kubectl create -f DemonSet.yaml
