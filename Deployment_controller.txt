STEPS TO UPDATE CONTAINER IMAGE USING DEPLOYMENT

1. Go inside "deployement.yaml" file 
2. Modify by increasing replicas from 1 to 2 and save
Example : 
	apiVersion: extensions/v1
	kind: Deployment
	metadata:
	  name: deployment-update
	spec:
	  replicas: 2
  
3. Then run following command to apply the modified deployment
	# kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
4. Again modify by decreasing replicas from 2 to 1 and save
5. Then run following command to apply the modified deployment
	# kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


OR
##Directly modify deployment strategies into deployment.yaml file
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1


maxUnavailable(0)	==> Maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process.
maxSurge(1)		==> maximum number of pods that can be created over the desired number of pods.
So kubernetes will deploy new version by incrementing/decrementing old version to new version internally to achieve 0 downtime.
